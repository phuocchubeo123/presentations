\begin{frame}{Input Assumptions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Disjoints balls
        \item Disjoint projection
        \item At least one dimension being $2\delta$ far away from others
    \end{itemize}

    \pause
    In this paper, we also assume that the distance is a power of $2$, so $\delta = 2^a$.
